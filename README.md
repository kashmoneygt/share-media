## Share Music on Spotify
1. Find a track on Spotify that you want to share. 
2. Copy its link by right clicking -> Share -> "Copy Song Link" or "Copy Spotify URI". You can do this on both Spotify Desktop and Web.
3. In OSRS, type "!share" to share the track. You and anyone who sees the share message will have their Share Links Panel on the right updated with the track.
4. If you want to check out the track, click the link in your Share Links Panel. You can choose whether to open the song in Desktop or Web in the plugin settings (Default: Web).
